## 💎 Introduction
This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) for a critical privilege escalation vulnerability discovered in the LiteSpeed Cache WordPress plugin. The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2024-28000, allows unauthorized users to gain Administrator-level access to a WordPress site by exploiting a weak security hash.


## 💀 Vulnerability Overview
The LiteSpeed Cache plugin's user simulation feature is protected by a security hash that is weak and predictable. This PoC demonstrates how an attacker can brute-force the security hash, gaining access to Administrator privileges on a targeted WordPress site.

## 🛠️ Development Environment Setup
- **.NET 8**
- **Newtonsoft.Json**

## 🔥 Requirements
There are no specific prerequisites needed to run this PoC.

## 📥 Download

## 📦 Setup and Usage
To use this PoC, simply run the executable and provide the target URL, desired admin username, and password. The exploit will attempt to brute-force the security hash to gain administrator access.

## 😎 Expected Output
If successful, the PoC allows unauthenticated users to gain Administrator-level access to a WordPress site by brute-forcing a weak security hash used in the plugin.

## ✅ Mitigation
The vulnerability has been patched in LiteSpeed Cache plugin version 6.4 and above. It is strongly recommended to update to the latest version to avoid this exploit.
